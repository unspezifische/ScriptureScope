# ScriptureScope
A website visualization tool for the Bible

This project allows people to view Bible passages as visually grouped by topic. It uses Python the NLTK library to analyize parsed USFM files, as uploaded by the user over at [www.unspezifische.com/ScriptureScope]. The visualization is done in the webpage using D3.js.

Best Practices for Using NLTK for Topic Modeling and Content Categorization

1. Start by familiarizing yourself with the NLTK library and its capabilities. Read the documentation and tutorials to understand how to use the library and its functions.

2. Pre-process your data by tokenizing, stemming, and lemmatizing it. This will help you to create a more accurate representation of the content.

3. Use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to create topic models. This algorithm is particularly effective for text data and can help you to uncover hidden topics in your data.

4. Utilize the Naive Bayes classifier to categorize your content. This algorithm is particularly effective for text data and can help you to accurately classify your content into different categories.

5. Use the TF-IDF algorithm to identify the most important words in your data. This algorithm can help you to identify the key topics and themes in your data.

6. Use the K-Means clustering algorithm to group similar documents together. This algorithm can help you to identify documents that are related to each other and can be used to create content categories.

7. Validate your results by manually inspecting the topics and categories that have been generated. This will help you to ensure that the topics and categories are accurate and relevant.

8. Experiment with different parameters and algorithms to find the best results. Try different combinations of parameters and algorithms to see which one produces the best results.
