# ScriptureScope
A website visualization tool for the Bible

This project allows people to view Bible passages as visually grouped by topic. It uses Python the NLTK library to analyize parsed USFM files, as uploaded by the user over at [www.unspezifische.com/ScriptureScope]. The visualization is done in the webpage using D3.js.
